## Why choose the 64-bit version of Office Professional Plus 2016?
     
The 64-bit version of Office Professional Plus 2016 can handle larger and more complex workloads than the 32-bit version. It can use more memory and CPU resources to perform faster and more smoothly. It can also work with larger files and data sets without running into limitations or errors. Some of the benefits of the 64-bit version are:
     
- It can open, save, and edit files that are larger than 2 GB in size.
- It can use up to 128 GB of memory (RAM) to run multiple applications and processes at the same time.
- It can handle more than 2 billion rows of data in Excel.
- It can work with very large PowerPoint presentations that contain high-resolution images and videos.
- It can integrate with other 64-bit applications and add-ins that enhance the functionality of Office.

The 64-bit version of Office Professional Plus 2016 is compatible with most of the features and formats of the previous versions of Office. However, there are some limitations and compatibility issues that you should be aware of before installing it. For example:

- You cannot install the 64-bit version of Office on a computer that already has a 32-bit version of Office installed. You have to uninstall the 32-bit version first.
- You cannot run the 64-bit version of Office on a computer that has a 32-bit processor or operating system. You need a computer that has a 64-bit processor and a 64-bit version of Windows.
- You may encounter some problems with some older or custom-made add-ins, macros, or ActiveX controls that were designed for the 32-bit version of Office. You may have to update or replace them with compatible versions.
- You may not be able to use some features or services that rely on the Microsoft SharePoint Server or Microsoft Exchange Server if they are not updated to support the 64-bit version of Office.
